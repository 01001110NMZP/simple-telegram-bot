# simple-telegram-bot
autumn task - task No.4

Disclaimer:

I started with my personal project some months ago, and I used AI to learn how to make Inline Buttons for the first time using them, then I picked it up and made a fully functional and scalable telegram bot

the thing is, I do use AI for some codes, but I dedicate some time actualy learning them, I hate assembling something that I dont not understrand

and I polished the bot too much even I thought it's AI generated, thus explainaning every single thing in it to show and tell that I know what I'm doing

thank you for the opportunity either way
